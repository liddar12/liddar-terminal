"""Feature layer: how the wide signal universe becomes point-in-time inputs.

The spine never assumes a causal link (e.g. "war moves gold"). It logs a
snapshot of everything knowable at prediction time and lets the scorer measure,
per cohort, whether predictions conditioned on those features actually beat a
baseline. Alignment is *earned* from resolved outcomes, not declared.

This module is implemented at Gate 1: the taxonomy, the snapshot record, the
no-lookahead validator, and the assembler are real and tested. The concrete
``FeaturePack`` bodies that fetch data live in ``families.py`` and raise
``NotImplementedError`` naming the gate that unlocks them (no silent stubs).
